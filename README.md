## ðŸ¤” What is Montara CI?

Montara CI is a GitHub Action that allows you to execute a pipeline test run in
Montara before merging a pull request. If the pipeline fails, the pull request
can not be merged.

## Getting started

- Create a [Montara accout](https://app.montara.io)

- Connect Montara to your data warehouse (see
  [Docs](https://app.montara.io/docs/docs/Settings/#warehouse-connection)).

- Connect Montara to your git repo in the
  [Montara settings page](https://app.montara.io/app/settings?selectedSettingsTab=2)
  (see
  [Docs](https://app.montara.io/docs/docs/Settings/Integrations/dbt/GitHubRepo/)).

- Montara CI triggers a test run via a webhook. Copy the webhook URL from the
  [pipeline settings page](https://app.montara.io/app/pipelines) in Montara.

- Create a `ci.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory with the
  following content:

```yaml
name: Montara CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'main'
      - 'montara_main'
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  montara:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Montara CI
        env:
          MONTARA_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MONTARA_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        uses: montara-io/montara-ci@v0.0.10
        with:
          webhookUrl: <replace-with-copied-webhook-url>
```

- You're good to go ðŸš€. Go ahead and create a new PR.

## Publishing a New Release

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent release tag by looking at the local data available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the latest release tag
   and provides a regular expression to validate the format of the new tag.
1. **Tagging the new release:** Once a valid new tag is entered, the script tags
   the new release.
1. **Pushing the new tag to the remote:** Finally, the script pushes the new tag
   to the remote repository. From here, you will need to create a new release in
   GitHub and users can easily reference the new tag in their workflows.
